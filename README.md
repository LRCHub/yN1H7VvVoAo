[00:01.07] Holding onto the memories
[00:03.49] If I'm speaking honestly
[00:05.13] No one did no wrong
[00:09.03] But now you're showing up unannounced
[00:11.58] Seen you've been creeping round instead of moving on
[00:37.58] 
[00:16.86] Now I'm happy
[00:20.92] Guess you can't be, oh
[00:31.92] 
[00:25.28] You could have left with I wish you the best
[00:28.42] But you're bitter instead
[00:30.27] And you hate that I'm in love
[00:33.41] You made a mess of what we put to bed
[00:36.57] Now you're back from the dead
[00:38.44] And you hate that I'm in love, oh
[00:54.94] 
[00:43.16] Reaching out 'cause you're now all alone
[00:47.26] What's that got to do with me, baby
[01:04.76] 
[00:49.61] You could've left with I wish you the best
[00:53.09] But you're bitter instead
[00:54.63] And you hate that I'm in love
[01:09.13] 
[00:57.83] Holding a pen so comfortably
[01:00.77] Can't rewrite history without empty pages
[01:06.02] Said you're glad that I moved on so fast
[01:08.63] It's good to see that your honesty isn't fading, baby
[01:35.13] 
[01:13.64] Now I'm happy
[01:17.74] Guess you can't be, oh
[01:28.74] 
[01:22.60] You could've left with I wish you the best
[01:25.49] But you're bitter instead
[01:27.30] And you hate that I'm in love
[01:30.47] You made a mess of what we put to bed
[01:33.57] Now you're back from the dead
[01:35.24] And you hate that I'm in love, oh
[01:51.74] 
[01:40.24] Reaching out 'cause you're now all alone
[01:44.24] What's it got to do with me, baby
[02:00.74] 
[01:46.52] You could've left with I wish you the best (I wish you the best)
[01:49.67] But you're bitter instead
[01:51.69] And you hate that I'm in love
[01:54.60] You could've just said
[01:56.94] That you wish me the best
[01:59.01] Instead, I'm in love and you hate it
[02:17.01] 
[02:02.97] You could've just said
[02:04.97] That you wish me the best
[02:07.27] Instead, I'm in love and you hate it
[02:16.48] Whoa, whoa, whoa
[02:24.48] 
[02:27.14] You could've left with I wish you the best
[02:30.60] But you're bitter instead
[02:32.34] And you hate that I'm in love
[02:35.41] You made a mess of what we put to bed
[02:38.73] Now you're back from the dead
[02:40.34] And you hate that I'm in love, oh
[02:56.84] 
[02:45.34] Reaching out 'cause you're now all alone
[02:49.04] What's it got to do with me, baby
[03:05.54] 
[02:51.81] You could've left with I wish you the best (I wish you the best)
[02:54.96] But you're bitter instead
[02:56.79] And you hate that I'm in love
